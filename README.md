LCG XML Parser
========

This parses XML returned from Local Calling Guide and returns the data
as CSV.  More info is in the header.

I wanted this to be fast (there is a LOT of data for this to go through),
and I had just spent some time learning C++ and Qt, so this was one of
the results of that.

Installation
------------

This is a Qt 4 program.  Use the appropriate qmake executable for your
platform to generate the Makefile and then make it.
